Convexity Signal Scanner
Purpose
Systematically identifies convexity inflection points—sharp trend reversals or accelerations—across liquid Indian equities for robust technical trading signals.

Trading Logic
Data: Automates download and cleaning of daily price/volume from NSE.

Filter: Selects stocks with high average daily volume (ADV).

Detection:

Calculates moving average (DMA) and its rolling slope (“angle”).

Flags when slope sharply flips from negative to positive with sufficient steepness—indicating convex price action.

Output: Ranks and saves tickers exhibiting convexity signals for screening, alerts, or strategy integration.
